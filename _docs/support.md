## Contribute to the project

If you want to contribute code, a good starting point is [our guide](https://github.com/mickael-kerjean/filestash/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md){:rel="nofollow"}.

Also there are many ways to contribute which don't involve coding or becoming a customer. For example, you can:
1. Improve the documentation: the website you are reading can be edited straight from the github interface.
2. Report bugs
